If you see this repository - because you are following me and received a notification, or simply because you are stalking me - well, first, stop stalking me. That's creepy. Second, this repository is kind of a top secret work in progress. I had to make it public to use Github Pages, but this repository is not meant to be seen, yet.

Therefore, if you are the best person in the world, **please don't look inside**. I would really appreciate it.

If you are not strong enough and can not stop stalking me and spying on what I do during my spare time, at least, can I ask you to keep to yourself what you'll see?

Thank you kindly.
